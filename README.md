# Home lab Network diagram
This repo shows Network diagram and lists Operating systems and Services that are used to build out my Home Lab. The idea behind building out a home lab is to ensure, the lab is network segmented, use a Firewall, set up scans to identify vulnerabilities etc. This repo also keep tracks of the changes/upgrades that are made to the lab over the period of time.
